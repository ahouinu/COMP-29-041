DESCRIPTION
       id3  is  an  ID3 v1.1 tag editor. ID3 tags are traditionally put at the
       end of compressed streamed audio files to denote information about  the
       audio  contents.  Up  to  thirty characters of Title, Artist, and Album
       information can be stored, as well as  a  28-character  comment,  four-
       digit year, track number up to 255, and an enumerated genre.

BUGS
       The ID3 format has some shortcomings. There is a 1 in  16777216  chance
       of your mp3 having a certain bit-pattern, causing id3 to write over the
       last 128 bytes of your mp3 upon tag creation. If you add a track number
       to  an ID3 v1.0 tag, the last two characters of the comment string will
       be truncated. Any bugs found in id3 should be forwarded to the  author,
       Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>.
